## Depatment of Digital Systems in Sparta, First Student Conference 2025

### *Welcome* to Dept._DS_Sparti_Students_Conference_2025 📜🎓

📌 This project was developed as part of my undergraduate thesis 🎓 at the *University of Peloponnese* 🏛️.
🎤 It was presented at the ***First Student Conference 2025***, held in **Sparta** 📍, on **14/03/2025** 📅.

### 📂 There are *three* different code files in this repository:

1️⃣ **API_Conf_DS_2025.py** 🧾
➡️ Uses a TXT file as input prompt

2️⃣ **API_PDF.py** 📄
➡️ Uses a PDF file as input prompt

3️⃣ **Steepest_Descent.py** 📐
➡️ Explains the Steepest Descent Method in detail, including extensive comments for better understanding

### In the first code, the following happens: ✅

- 📦 The code first imports the OpenAI library and creates a client object that connects to the OpenAI API, using the API key provided by the user. 🔑🤖

- 📂 It then attempts to open the file prompt.txt in read mode and read its contents. If the file does not exist, ❌ an error message is displayed and the program terminates. ⚠️

- 📤 After reading the file content, the program sends this prompt to the OpenAI gpt-4o-mini model via the client.chat.completions.create() method. This method generates a completion response based on the given text, which is stored in the completion variable. 🧠✨

- 📝 From this response, the program extracts the first message generated by the model and stores it in the output_message variable. It then creates or opens a file named output.txt and writes the model’s response into it. 💾📄

- ✅ Finally, it displays the message “Output has been written to output.txt” on the console, informing the user that the process was successfully completed and that the requested queries have been generated. 🎉🖥️

### In the second code, the following happens: ✅

- 📄 The code reads the contents of a PDF file named document.pdf, extracting all its text using the PyPDF2 library. If the file is not found, ❌ an error message is displayed and the program terminates. ⚠️

- 🧠 It then creates a prompt that asks OpenAI’s gpt-4o-mini model to generate 10 multiple-choice questions in Greek 🇬🇷, based on the text extracted from the PDF. The questions focus on Artificial Intelligence and Steepest Descent, include 5 possible answers (with one correct answer ✅), and are categorized by difficulty level using a Likert scale from 1 to 5 📊
(1 = very easy, 5 = very difficult, with a predefined distribution across levels).

- 📤 The program sends this prompt to the OpenAI API via a client object created using the user’s API key 🔑🤖. The model processes the input and generates the requested questions. ✨

- 💾 The response (i.e. the generated questions and answers) is then saved to an output.txt file, which is created or overwritten if it already exists. 📄📝

- ✅ Finally, the program displays the message “The questions were saved to the file output.txt” on the console, confirming that the process was successfully completed and that the generated questions are available. 🎉🖥️

### In the third code, the following happens: ✅

- 📐 The code implements the Steepest Descent algorithm to find the local minimum of a function of two variables. It first asks the user to provide the initial point (x₀, y₀), the function to minimize, the learning rate, and the termination constants c1, c2, c3. These constants determine when the algorithm stops:
  
   🔹 when the slope becomes very small
  
   🔹 when the distance between consecutive points or the difference in function values is small
  
   🔹 or when the maximum number of iterations is exceeded

- 🧮 The algorithm then computes the partial derivatives of the function and iteratively updates the points along the steepest descent direction, using the learning rate, while recording all visited points and function values. 🔄📊

- ⏱️ The process continues until one of the stopping criteria is met or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

- 📊📈 Finally, the program displays the results, including the minimum point, the corresponding function value, the termination criterion that was satisfied, and the total number of iterations. Additionally, it generates 3D surface plots and 2D contour plots that visually illustrate the path of the algorithm toward the minimum point. 🎯✨
